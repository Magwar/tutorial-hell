        I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, beautiful, and intuitive
        designs. When I’m not coding, I’m usually learning something new or
        refining my skills.
      </p>

      <p className="max-w-2xl">
        My current focus is on React, modern JavaScript, and building projects
        that feel good to use.
